# Abstract

In this talk we first consider the situation where one is interested 
in gaining understanding of general dynamical properties of a chaotically 
time evolving system solely through access to time series measurements 
that depend on the evolving state of an, otherwise unknown, system. 
Using examples, we show that machine learning is an extremely effective 
tool for accomplishing this task, and we discuss how the ability to do 
this can be of practical utility.

In the second part of the talk, we turn the problem around and utilize 
chaos theory to explain the dynamical basis for how a machine learning 
system is able to do accomplish this task 
[Z. Lu, B. Hunt and E. Ott, CHAOS (2018)].

Edward Ott received his Ph.D. from The Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn 
and was an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at Cambridge University, 
following which he became a faculty member of the Department of Electrical 
Engineering at Cornell University. After 11 years at Cornell, he moved 
to the University of Maryland where he is currently a Distinguished 
University Professor in the Department of Physics and the Department of 
Electrical and Computer Engineering. Prof. Ott is best known for his 
research in basic and applied aspects of chaotic dynamics for which 
he has received several notable honors, e.g., the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize 
from the American Physical Society ( "For pioneering contributions in 
nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory....") He is an author of over 
400 published scientific papers, as well as the book, 
"Chaos in Dynamical Systems.‚Äù
