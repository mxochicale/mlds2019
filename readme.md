##  Quantification of Dynamic Facial Expressions with Shannon Entropy in Human-Humanoid Interaction

Research on understanding and quantifying movement variability 
with nonlinear analyses has been well established in the last three 
decades in areas such as biomechanics, sport science, psychology, 
cognitive science, and neuroscience (davids et al. 2003).
This work is hypothesising that nonlinear analyses 
can be used to quantify subtle variations of facial expressions 
that can be related to different mental states 
(i.e. anxiety, disinterest, relief, etc) (Back et al 2014).
This hypothesis has then led the author to ask two research questions: 
how the quantification of facial expressions can be related to  
the complexity of facial expressions?, and 
does the quantification of the complexity for facial expressions 
can tell us something about the state of mind of a person?
