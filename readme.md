# Symposium on Machine Learning and Dynamical Systems, Imperial College London, Feb. 11-13, 2019

The intersection of the fields of dynamical systems and machine learning is largely unexplored, 
and the goal of this symposium is to bring together researchers from these fields to fill the 
gap between the theories of dynamical systems and machine learning in the following directions:
* Machine Learning for Dynamical Systems: how to analyze dynamical systems on the basis of observed 
	data rather than attempt to study them analytically.
* Dynamical Systems for Machine Learning: how to analyze algorithms of Machine Learning using tools 
	from the theory of dynamical systems.

## Organizers
	Boumediene Hamzi, Yi-Ke Guo, 
	Jeroen Lamb, Diana O'Malley (Imperial College London) and 
	Robert MacKay (University of Warwick and The Alan Turing Institute)
